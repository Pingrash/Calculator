## **v1.0**

Advanced Calculator Project

Hosted Version - https://js-calc-example.netlify.com/

The base of this project is based on the tutorial by youtuber PortExe (https://youtu.be/6v4vBXL-qkY).

### Features added by me:

- Responsive CSS for mobile screens
- Added sidebar with additional functions
- Added keypress events to allow for keyboard input (primary keys only)
- Added display element for the equation
- Automatic resizing of number text in display element based on number of numbers displayed to try and prevent overflow
