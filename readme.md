## **v1.0**
Advanced Calculator Project

The base of this project is based on the tutorial by youtuber PortExe (https://youtu.be/6v4vBXL-qkY).

### To-Do:
- Figure out additional button functions (sin, cos, tan, etc)
- Would like to make some sort of graphing functionality but likely will be a seoerate project

### Features added by me:
- Responsive CSS for mobile screens
- Added sidebar with additional functions
- Added keypress events to allow for keyboard input (primary keys only)
- Added display element for the equation
- Automatic resizing of number text in display element based on number of numbers displayed to try and prevent overflow
